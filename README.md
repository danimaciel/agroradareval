# AgroRadarEval - Data and Code Repository

This repository contains the data, code, and supplementary materials associated with the article "Data-driven RD&I management for societal impacts through evaluation results: introducing and applying AgroRadarEval". AgroRadarEval aims to support leaders and managers in agricultural RD&I by reflecting on organizational capacities, culture, collaborations, processes, and communications underlying the use of evaluation results. The approach incorporates principles from Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) and Responsible Research Assessment (RRA) to ensure that evaluation processes are inclusive, transparent, and aimed at societal impact.

## About AgroRadarEval

AgroRadarEval is a tool built to support leaders and managers in agricultural research, development, and innovation (RD&I). It aims to facilitate reflections on the strengths and weaknesses of organizational capacities, culture, collaborations, processes, and communications that underlie the effective use of evaluation results in agricultural RD&I.

The tool is built upon three support pillars:

1. **Evaluation Capacity Building (ECB)**: Ensuring the organization has the skills, knowledge, and infrastructure necessary for conducting and using evaluations.
2. **Impact-Oriented Evaluation Culture**: Fostering an environment where evaluation results are used to inform decisions and drive impact.
3. **Reflexivity**: Encouraging ongoing reflection and adaptation of practices based on the findings from evaluations.

These pillars are operationalized through eight interconnected dimensions:

1. **Participation and Collaboration**
2. **Skills Development**
3. **Promotion of an Evaluation Culture**
4. **Continuous Feedback and Adaptation**
5. **Integration with Strategic Planning**
6. **Monitoring**
7. **Influences of the External Environment**
8. **Communication**
